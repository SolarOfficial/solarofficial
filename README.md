What's up everyone, My name is Auryn. I'm just your neighborhood discord.js developer! I am the Founder of HCReaper an upcoming Minecraft server!

I also have my own website! https://solardev.xyz

JavaScript is not all I know, I actually have started a bit of Python! I am still very new to coding so I am glad to be apart of GitHub now! I have always been into computers and stuff since I was like 6 years old!

I also have a dog named Vega and she is AWESOME! Here's a picture: https://solardev.xyz/secret.html

My main project at the moment is HCReaper (My minecraft server 😎)

Here are some things about me:
